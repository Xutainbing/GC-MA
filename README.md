## Single-cell transcriptome profiling of gastric cancer malignant ascites reveals immunosuppressive remodeling and epithelial-immune dual phenotype cells as predictive biomarkers for PD-1 immunotherapy
Gastric cancer malignant ascites (GCMA), a highly immunosuppressive liquid tumor microenvironment, remains poorly characterized in terms of cellular heterogeneity and immune mechanisms. We performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling on matched malignant ascites (MA) and PBMC samples from 10 gastric cancer patients to delineate the immune landscape and tumor microenvironment dynamics. Comprehensive analysis identified profound remodeling of T, B, dendritic, and myeloid cell subsets in MA, alongside enhanced immune activation, clonal expansion, and terminal differentiation. Notably, we discovered a novel epithelial-immune dual phenotype cell (EIDPC) population exhibiting intermediate malignancy and strong immune regulatory properties. Functional and trajectory analyses revealed transcriptional reprogramming toward immune modulation and immune escape. We developed an immune response signature of EIDPC (IRS-EIDPC) score based on 10 core genes, which robustly predicted PD-1 immunotherapy response and prognosis across multiple independent cohorts. These findings highlight immune plasticity within the ascitic tumor microenvironment and establish EIDPCs as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer.
